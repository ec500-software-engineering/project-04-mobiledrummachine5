# Mobile Drum Machine
An Android drum machine include a live mode and an AR mode. Final project for EC500 Software Engineering.
## Description
A mobile drum machine with a basic live mode and an AR mode. Play with drums at any time and be a rockstar! All the sampled drum sounds are from [Ableton Live 10 Lite](https://www.ableton.com/en/products/live-lite/). 
### Live Mode
Live mode provides 12 drum pads with 12 different drum sounds.

Some useful functions are included:
* **Node repeat**   
In a real live, you may want a fixed drum sequence where drums are repeating in different speeds or frequencies. A repeat frequency ranged from single to quartic in a single tempo can be selected, and BPM can be ranged from 40 to 160.
* **Force sensitive drum**   
You may expect different responces from the drum when you hit a real drum with different forces. And just like real drum, the drum pads in live mode are also force sensitive. The volumn of drum sounds varies corresponding to how hard you hit them.
* **Record and save**   
Sometimes your inspirations just come out with no advance and you don't want to miss them. Record your genius by click the record button and save them to local. You can review them so that you won't forget.   
   
   
### AR Mode
AR mode is built in [Unity](https://unity.com/), work with [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) AR engine. Once the [image](https://github.com/ec500-software-engineering/project-04-mobiledrummachine5/blob/master/Assets/drum1.jpg) of drum in this application is detected, you will have your drum kit all set. The single piece of drum image, which is absolutely light and portable, will be your new drum machine and you can take it anywhere. **THE IMAGE IS A DRUM MACHINE!!!**

* Drum pads are built with ```virtual buttons```. To play the drum, simply by cover the virtual button region (just like you push a real button) and the corresponding drum sound will be played.   
* For the reason of size and scale, only three drum pads (hihat, snare and kick) are add to AR activity. For the Unity and Vuforia development part, see [VuforiaDev](https://github.com/ec500-software-engineering/project-04-mobiledrummachine5/tree/VuforiaDev) branch. The further step of developing AR activity could be working on:
   + Adding more drum pads to the scene.
   + Adding animation on different part of the drum kit when hitting a drum pad.
   + ...
