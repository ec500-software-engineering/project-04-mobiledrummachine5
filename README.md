# Vuforia & Unity Development Branch
This branch mainly focus on build ```AR activity``` of the drum, using [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/) engines for the reason that [ARcore](https://developers.google.com/ar/) has very limited AR functions. The goal is to build ```virtual buttons``` function from ```Vuforia``` to Android.
